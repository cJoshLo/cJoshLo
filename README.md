Hi, Iâ€™m Joshua Lopez

I am a Software Engineer currently currently looking for new opportunities.

My most resent project is building an e-commerce auction site through the use of Django framework to efficiently 
build RESTful architecture by writing router and controllers to modularize backend requests,
thus enhancing code readability and scalability. 

I have also worked with creating a Spotify mini player to run on a small 6inch monitor through the use of API calls and working to help build open
source projects with other GitHub users.
