Hi, Iâ€™m Joshua Lopez

I am a Software Engineer currently currently looking for new opportunities.

My most resent project is using the framework Spring to code an N tier design pattern RESTful API. I did this by coding an API layer, Service layer, and Database Access layer which connects to PostgreSQL. Using Java I implemented GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE allowing users to interacte with the API.

I have also built an e-commerce auction site through the use of Django framework to efficiently build RESTful architecture by writing router and controllers to modularize backend requests, thus enhancing code readability and scalability. Users are able to create an account and POST items to the database for auction. Other users can then bid on these items until the auction ends.
