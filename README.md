Hi, Iâ€™m Joshua Lopez

I am a Software Engineer currently currently looking for new opportunities.

My most resent project is building an e-commerce auction site through the use of Django framework to efficiently 
build RESTful architecture by writing router and controllers to modularize backend requests,
thus enhancing code readability and scalability.
